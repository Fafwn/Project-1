The intention for this file is to efficiently read STORYBOARD.txt in a fashion similar to cpu architecture.
Each line break will represent a new Text Pointer (TP), and will begin with a bunch of flags before the text.

For example, TP 39 = #!3npc1,Hello Traveller! My name is [?31]
which would be the flags:
# - All caps
!npc1 - npc1 header
, - separates flags from text
Hello Traveller! My name is - Text
[?31] - Pull character name from memory

Which would be output to Typewriter as:

- Hello Traveller! My name is [?31]
Flags {All caps: True}

You will also be able to jump to specific TPs, and there will be flags to represent the end of a "Scene".
Storyboard will load a scene into "RAM" memory, loading in as much information as possible. For example, there could be
a short conversation between the main and supporting character. STORYBOARD.py would load their "scene" into a stack and
run the conversation back to Typewriter.py in order.
