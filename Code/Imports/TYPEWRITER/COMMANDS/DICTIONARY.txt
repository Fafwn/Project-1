HI THERE

simple explanation of how this branch works.

MEMORY.py <- FLAGS.CSV
MEMORY.py reads from FLAGS.CSV, loading in all the data. The data within FLAGS.CSV is ordered in the following:

________________________________
|Name|Variable(!)/Flag(?)|Value|
|____|___________________|_____|

MEMORY.py will then create 2 dictionaries:
- Var [variables]
- Flag [flags]

MEMORY.py will then have built-in functions to update each list:
COMPLETE THIS PART LOL


| TRANSLATOR.py | MEMORY.py |
These two will work together, where TRANSLATOR will work on a string based off flags noted in MEMORY
For example:
charHead = "-"

"[charHead] Hello World!" > TRANSLATOR.py > "- Hello World!"
