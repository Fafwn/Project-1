Tryna make sense of stuff

SO you have the main program which is the top level

then you have a secondary level which is fed directly to the main top level. these are the main subsections such as:
character handling
Text handling
combat handling
etc

These secondary level functions will have third level objects that are directly used only by the corresponding secondary level handlers
these work in a console terminal type of way, possessing their own individual internal commands, a input, and a output.
You input data into the object, and it spits out corresponding data depending on internal logic.

Secondary level functions will import all lower third level functions it needs and handles the passing of information between third level
objects. each third level object will be a child object from a parent object called console that sorts out the formatting of the objects and ensures
that they can all be read the same way and makes it easier to add new modules to the code.

The main level will handle the logging, third level branch console importing, and the functional runtime of the program.


I need to draw this out or something jesus fucking christ



Top level - Handler

Secondary level - subparts

Third level - components




each secondary level component will have a import dictionary that has directories as indexes, and an array of files as values

BLEAH

Second level needs to inherit every third level

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
