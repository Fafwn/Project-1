Putting things aside for now since theres a cosmic fuck tonne of things to do rn. SO im gonna try split the work into 
parts and ensure Ive got everything


To simplify, I wnt there to be an inclusion for everything

the whole GUI will be its own separate section with probably the most work in it because it will directly link the whole program together

the main gui will essentially be the program itself but will be directly linked to the top tier program 



Bits i can think of off the top of my head when it comes to the actual game itself is a separate engine for:

- Map handling
- Cutscene handling 
- Character handling
- Battle handling
- Typewriter
- Inventory Handling
- 


And then separate from that are components for the game developer itself:

- GUI
- AHHHHHHHH

come to realise how big of a challenge this will be but dont bite the hand that fingers you or whatever
