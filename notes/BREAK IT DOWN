ITS SO BEYOND IMPORTANT TO EMPHASISE THE BREAKDOWN.

This game will be huge
lots of working parts, parts that should not interact with each other. because of this, using a modular approach is essential
to separate code. if one module goes completely caput, it wont affect other modules.

splitting things into parts is hard to visualise, but the idea is you have the
GUI
text handler
character handler
battle handler
etc

therefore if you need to change how battles work, you simply replace and plug in a new battle handler and itll run everything
it needs from that module. also makes it easier to fix shit when it goes wrong because if a visual error happens, you know
its to do with the GUI

sounds patronising but if we get on the same page then i can miraculously suck your metaphorical ethereal dong
